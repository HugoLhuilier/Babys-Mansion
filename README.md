# Rules of the game 
 You are in a mansion/labyrinth and your goal is to escape. The exit is marked with a blue floor.
 There is a ghost of a baby following you around. Every ten to twenty seconds you here the baby crying/laughing 
 so you can know whether it is far from you and in which direction.
 On you way out you may encounter some lantern that expands your vision temporarly, you can use them as many times as you want.
 If the baby gets to you before you get to the exit, the game is lost. 

 Good luck and have fun ;)
